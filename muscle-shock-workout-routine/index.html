<p><strong>Muscle Shock Workout Routine</strong>, The concept of complexes is actually fairly simple: The idea that you need to constantly change up your exercises, rep ranges and workout structure in order to “shock” or “confuse” your muscles into new growth is a fairly common piece of bodybuilding advice you’ll hear. Electrical muscle stimulation claims to help you do hours of toning in just 20 minutes, but does an ems workout do what it says and is it safe? As for recovery from the workout itself, ural suggests waiting a few hours to do a full body stretch because there is too much tone (excitement of the muscles) happening in the minutes right after class.</p>
