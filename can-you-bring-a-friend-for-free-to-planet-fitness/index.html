<p>Yes, the planet fitness week pass costs $5 per week. This “unlimited” is for the gym member to bring someone daily instead of limited to 1 or 2 per month as standard plans allow for. I am not allowed to answer that question. The guest must be 18+ or 13+ with a parent or guardian. Gym in Ellicott City, MD 8450 Baltimore National Pike.</p>
