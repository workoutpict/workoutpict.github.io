<p>Well, gironda�s founding principle was to always strive to do more work in less time. Should you opt for a bodybuilding split, stick to three or four exercises for the larger muscle groups like legs, chest, and back. Basically taking a lower weight and doing 8 reps by 8 repitiitions and boy is it harder than i thought. I read in a muscle mag recently about the 8x8 workout. 8x8 Workout Lean Muscle Gainz Workout in 2020 Chest.</p>
