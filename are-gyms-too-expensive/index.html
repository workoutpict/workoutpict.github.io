<p>So when i ask to cancel my membership due to the cost the manager gave me a deal for $39 a month. All access to monthy recorded total body workouts. For example just training muay thai is $120 a month but if you want to train bjj you have to double the pay or for $ 200 month you can sign a long term. Fitness is not too expensive. Face the Facts Face Gym Is Too Expensive Washington.</p>
