The anytime fitness in north toronto is not very up front about their rates (surprise!) but offered a one year contract at $24 every two weeks (which comes out to $52/month). Expect to pay somewhere around $36 per month to join anytime fitness (or $49 in canada), plus annual fees, activation fees, etc. Anytime Fitness Hamilton Everything you need to know.</p>

<p>To us, it means creating a plan that truly fits your life. It means a coach and a community to support you in every possible way. Franchisees are the ones in charge of pricing, so expect that your local anytime fitness may not charge the same rates as those in other towns. And it means more options to work out anytime, anywhere. Anytime fitness.</p>
