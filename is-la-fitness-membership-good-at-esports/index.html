<p>If you�re currently on an la fitness plan and want to switch to the new esporta $9.99/mo plan, you will have to pay a $99 conversion fee and then a $50/year fee on top of the $9.99 (making it $14/month, excluding the conversion fee). So in my location they just changed the la fitness into esporta, which means the pricing is way off too. The general manager had no explanation as to why i�d have to pay a $99 conversion fee (thats just the way it is). The organisation has partnered with la fitness, and the wellness app simple habit, to launch their campaign. Why should gyms be considered essential services? La.</p>
