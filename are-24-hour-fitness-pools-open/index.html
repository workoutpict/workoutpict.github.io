<p>If you�re looking to get in your cardio, they have over 15 stair master�s, 20 elliptical�s, 20 treadmills, 10 amt machines, 20 recumbent/standard bicycles, and 2 rowing machines. This is an advantage if swimming is part of your workout routine, or if you’re in physical therapy and your doctor has given you pool workouts as part of your recovery.
