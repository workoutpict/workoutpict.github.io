<p>I think it depends on what the individual person is looking for or likes to do. I decided to give their streaming workout service, beachbody on demand, a try to find out for myself. Some people really like the cardio, so insanity is great for them, while others like the weightlifting and muscle work, so i would recommend p90x to them. My cardio, strength, and endurance have all been better after insanity. Resting when you�re tired is not a good scale for a workout imo.</p>

<p>With this insanity review, i’m finishing up my second complete week with the insanity workout. It only takes 30 minutes 6 times a week, which is great compared to most of these insane workout programs. I think this program is working both my physical conditioning and my mental perseverance.
