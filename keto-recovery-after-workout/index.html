<p>Even after you introduce the keto diet to your hiit program, you should know that it is easy to overdo the two of them. It’s best to avoid eating a lot of carbs following a workout because this can cause blood sugar fluctuations which may slow recovery time and impede weight loss results later on down the line. This is because your body will have more oxygen in the blood stream to depend on, allowing easier recovery time for your muscles and respiratory system after a workout. Another problem with the keto diet when it comes to workout recovery is how it affects central fatigue, meaning feelings of tiredness caused by changes in brain chemicals.
