<p><strong>Should You Drink Pre Workout Before Cardio</strong>, A banana with nut butter, especially almond butter. Always eat a balance of real food carbohydrates, protein, and healthy fats before a cardio workout. Your glycogen stores are full and you are most energetic at the beginning of your workout.

What Should I Eat Before Working Out? 10 Snacks To Fuel From pinterest.com</p>
<p>If you�re aiming for a long cardio session, add some yogurt, an egg, a slice of cheese or a small piece of meat — this protein will help power you through a longer workout. While supplements such as creatine and caffeine are best suited to intense bursts of energy, the fact that they improve endurance as well as muscle contractions suggests they may also be utilized for steady cardio. About 20 to 30 minutes before your workout, drink another 8 ounces. And a 2016 study found that when cardio was performed before resistance training, the participants demonstrated a decrease in muscular power and an increase in perceived exertion.</p>

While you are exercising, drink 7 to 10 ounces every 10 to 20 minutes. As long as you also drink water to prevent dehydration, and don’t feel jittery or nauseous from having coffee alone, then this seems to be a fine option.
