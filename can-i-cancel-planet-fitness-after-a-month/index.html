<p>You have to have been a member at one location for at least 90 days, you must have a monthly (not annual or prepaid) membership, and you can’t owe any outstanding dues or fees at your current club. It finally stopped about 3 months after i noticed i was still paying, approximately 30 phone calls, more faxes/emails/letters than i could even guess at and not a single apology for them or refund for the extra time i spent trying to cancel and or for the extra months i paid for that i didn�t use. If you have a 12 month commitment and you are cancelling before the 12 months are up (i.e you signed up in january and are cancelling 7 months later in july), there is a $58 cancellation fee. No, planet fitness doesn’t offer a refund if you cancel your membership early in the billing cycle. Shop7u cancel fitness membership BLINK FITNESS GOOD.</p>
