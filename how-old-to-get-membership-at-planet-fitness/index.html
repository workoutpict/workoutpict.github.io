<p>That means you can bring a guest with you at any time. Planet fitness free trial is only for local residents. The brand of the machines is life fitness, and i found a life fitness connect app on the google play store but it would not connect to the machines. If i had one judgment to make when it comes to planet fitness it would be that it is so easy to become a member of the gym. Gym in Southgate, MI 13591 Eureka Rd Fitness.</p>
