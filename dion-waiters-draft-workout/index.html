<p>There is no question in my mind when we look back at this draft we will all say dion waiters went before x, y, z!!! Hate it or love it but the cavs done f*d up. Dion waiters set for a workout with the los angeles lakers. Waiters also showed he has some ability when attacking the basket. Dion Waiters would love the opportunity to play point.</p>
