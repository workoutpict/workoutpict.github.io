Carbon is not a dirty word the case for recarbonizing our From agfundernews.com</p>
<p>It is crazy to think that need for speed: The classical source of chirality in a (organic) compound is the presence of a carbon atom with four different substituents. As the fire grows, a hot smoke layer accumulates beneath the ceiling and temperatures gradually increase. This experiment uses carbon dioxide created from the chemical reaction between baking soda and vinegar to put out a fire.</p>
