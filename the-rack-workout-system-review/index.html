<p><strong>The Rack Workout System Review</strong>, I had the rack several years ago and, like an idiot, i got rid of it for some reason. It has some dings and scratches on it from the years but it�s still sturdy and i�ve only had to tighten the bolts a couple of times. Low rows are very smooth on the powertec, but they do need to be done from the floor rather than on a bench. You are getting the whole set with two different workout handles in less than $50.</p>
