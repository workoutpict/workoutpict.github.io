<p>Does 24 hour fitness have a free trial? You are allowed to bring one guest who will be with you at all times while you are working out. When you join planet fitness, you can pay a flat fee of $10 a month and have access to all of the weight training and cardio equipment in the gym on a daily basis. Regarding your membership, we have put your account on hold for the duration we are closed and we are waiving all freeze fees. Gym in Moline, IL 3624 Avenue of the Cities Fitness.</p>

<p>Mostly, you may need a black card in order to bring a guest, but at some locations, even classic members can bring guests. You can also contact any planet fitness near you and check if they can give you an offer as a prospect client. This “unlimited” is for the gym member to bring someone daily instead of limited to 1 or 2 per month as standard plans allow for. The focal point of planet fitness is to eliminate the pressure and stress that comes from gymtimidation while participating in fitness training.
