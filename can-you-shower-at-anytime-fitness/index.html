<p>It must vary location to location, i am a member and have seen 5 locations ranging from awesome modern cardio equipment good free weights, machines and private shower/changing rooms, to broken worn out equipment with a few pink dumbells and moldy shower/locker rooms. The shower area and free beauty bar at anytime fitness is stocked with shampoo, soaps, deodorant, and other great amenities! The gym works by giving you a digital key that will unlock the doors. Company reviews offer a great insight into how a business is run, operated, and the overall gym experience. Clean showers Yelp.</p>
