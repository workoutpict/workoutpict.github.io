<p>Join the conversation on twitter/instagram:@jockowillink @echocharles excerpt from jockopodcast 14 In keeping with his military training, jocko lays out all his clothes for the following day before he turns in each night. He says he�s broken down his workout into four broad spectrums, he pulls on the first day, pushes on the next day, lifts on the third day, and squats on the fourth day. He believes in taking rest days, providing a workout plan that is only 4 days a week. Gladiator Project • Zach EvenEsh.</p>
