<p>When you sweat, your pores open, and if you�re wearing makeup, the combination of sweat and oil can clog your pores. Skin is extra sensitive following a workout, so make sure to gently cleanse your face. Since i usually exercise first thing in the morning, i don’t do anything to my face when i first wake up. Washing your face is the first step in any skin care routine, but what if you’re strapped for time at the gym? Pin on Get Healthy.</p>
