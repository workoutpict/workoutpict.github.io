<p>Plyometrics are part of an explosive training workout. The number of throws back to the pitcher (60 ft, 6 in), the number of sprints to back up. The weights are lighter and cause the lifter to use more stabilizers. Baseball players do not need much isolation exercise at all so doing a routine with body part splits like back/bicep day is not necessary and will really not improve your athletic performance, simply put that is a bodybuilding routine not an athlete�s routine. Update on Carmel youth baseball player who suffered near.</p>
