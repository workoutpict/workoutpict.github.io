<p><strong>Why Can T I Move My Arms After A Workout</strong>, After your pacemaker is implanted, you may move your arm normally and do not have to restrict its motion during normal daily activities. It’s this quick onset soreness that you feel in the gym, between sets, or right after you finish your workout. What i think could have happened is a light pulling of some tendons in the elbow, due to incorrect form of exercising. However, if there is an insult to the capsule that causes a clinical condition such as adhesive capsulitis (frozen shoulder), then the capsule can become very stiff and less pliable.</p>
