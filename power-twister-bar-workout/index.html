<p>The exercise you perform with a power twister bar seems simple, but the resistance that the spring coil gives makes it challenging. I just bought a 60kg one, but i cannot bend it at all. 11 mins 44 secs, moderate. This power twister is just all the equipment needed to set up a home gym and work out to your heart�s content.
