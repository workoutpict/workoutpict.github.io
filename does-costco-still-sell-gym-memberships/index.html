I was reading that costco backdates membership renewal, so for example if your membership were to expire june 1st, and you paid the 55$ for renewal on july 1st, you�d be paying full price for 11 months (it still expires june 1st the following year). Depending on the location, membership fees typically range between $31.99 to $56.99 per month, which means this discount is a significant percentage off if you break things down annually. ↑ hey guys, just a quick question.</p>
